# ABA-trilayer-graphene
these codes are used to calculate nonlinear optics coefficients of the second harmonic generation in trilayer graphene, which belongings to a research program in Changchun Insititue of Optics, Fine Mecahnics and Phycics(CIOMP)
##
More specifictly, there are some parameters describing the nonlinear optics process in the ABA trilayer graphene
By fortran90
In this program, we set some parameters, numk for divide number , w for energy and gamma for the complex part of the frequency.Finally we get the conductivity and polarzation of the ABA stacked trilayer graphene.
