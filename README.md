# ABA-trilayer-graphene
some parameters on the nonlinear-optics of the ABA trilayer graphene
By fortran90
In this program, we set some parameters, numk for divide number , w for energy and gamma for the complex part of the frequency.Finally we get the conductivity and polarzation of the ABA stacked trilayer graphene.
